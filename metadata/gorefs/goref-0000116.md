## Automatic Gene Ontology annotation based on Rhea mapping.

Rhea (https://www.rhea-db.org/, PMID:30272209) is a comprehensive and non-redundant resource of chemical and transport reactions of biological interest.
Rhea describes chemical transformations in a computationally tractable manner. GO terms corresponding to Rhea reactions are assigned a Rhea database cross-reference. 
The corresponing GO term is automatically applied to all UniProt entries annotated with a Rhea reaction. 
The mapping file is available at: http://current.geneontology.org/ontology/external2go/rhea2go.
