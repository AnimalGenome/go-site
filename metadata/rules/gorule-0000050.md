Do not annotate exceptions are encoded as tuples of (gene, term, reason, pmid). This indicates that gene/product should never be annotated directly to term, or to an ancestor of term following is-a and part-of. 

For GAF or GPAD filtering, these are treated as errors and filtered. For implementation in a curation tool such as Noctua or PAINT the curator should be blocked from making such an annotation.

The location for the blacklist file is purl://... / http://current.geneontology.org/...
