- GO taxon constraints ensure that annotations are not made to inappropriate species or sets of species. 
This information is obtained from the only_in_taxon and never_in_taxon tags in the ontology (maintained in go-ontology/tree/master/src/taxon_constraints). 
- Experimental annotations (1) failing the taxon constraints are reported in the error reports but unchanged; non-experimental annotations (2) are filtered out of the pipeline products.
(1) EXP evidence codes: EXP, IDA, IEP, IGC, IGI, IMP, IPI, HDA, HEP, HGI, HMP, HTP.
(2) non EXP annotations: IBA, IKR, IRD, IC, ISA, ISM, ISO, ISS, NAS, RCA, TAS.
- Note that taxon constraints DO NOT apply to NOT annotations.
