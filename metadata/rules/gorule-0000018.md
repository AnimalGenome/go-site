All IPI annotations should include a nucleotide/protein/chemical
identifier in the "With/From" column (column 8). From the [description
of IPI in the GO evidence code guide](http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml#ipi):
"We strongly recommend making an entry in the with/from column when using this
evidence code to include an identifier for the other protein or other
macromolecule or other chemical involved in the interaction. When
multiple entries are placed in the with/from field, they are separated
by pipes. Consider using IDA when no identifier can be entered in the
with/from column."
